### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **OpenAI releases Codex Desktop App.**
    OpenAI's new Codex Desktop App is here! This bad boy is a dedicated [command center (AI News)](https://www.xiaohu.ai/c/xiaohu-ai/openai-codex-skills-5f0c89) for multi-agents, designed to tackle multiple tasks concurrently, way beyond simple Q&A code snippets. Each agent runs on its own independent thread, keeping things neatly organized by project. Plus, it lets multi-agents work on isolated copies using Git Worktree, and you can even define **custom skills** for synchronous use across the whole system. Super slick!

2.  **Zhipu GLM-5 and MiniMax M2.2 to Launch Before Chinese New Year.**
    Get ready for Zhipu GLM-5 and MiniMax M2.2, dropping before February 15th! Zhipu AI's [GLM-5 model (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/25219) is set to debut with major breakthroughs in creative writing, programming, and reasoning. Meanwhile, MiniMax's **M2.2 version** is being hailed as a programmer's "secret weapon" for its seriously enhanced programming capabilities. DeepSeek only got minor V3 series updates, so we're still patiently waiting for their trillion-parameter flagship. And guess what? ByteDance and Alibaba are also gearing up to unleash some new models! Exciting times!

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **Tencent Hunyuan Releases CL-bench Evaluation Benchmark.**
    Tencent Hunyuan just dropped their new CL-bench evaluation benchmark! This is Yao Shunyu's first co-authored [paper (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2026-02-03-7) since joining Tencent, and it’s all about testing if models can actually learn new stuff from context and apply it right. The results? A bit of a reality check 😬: models only managed to solve an average of **17.2% of tasks**, and even the mighty GPT-5.1 only hit 23.7%. Ouch! It's clear that models are still struggling to truly utilize context.

2.  **ProjDevBench Evaluates AI End-to-End Project Development.**
    ProjDevBench is here to evaluate AI's end-to-end project development skills. While many existing benchmarks are all about bug fixing, this [new benchmark (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01655) specifically measures the ability to go from initial requirements all the way to a complete, functional repository. It features 20 coding challenges across 8 categories, combining OJ testing with **LLM code review**. The catch? Six coding agents only managed an overall pass rate of **27.38%**. Looks like complex system design is still a huge Achilles' heel for them 🤦‍♀️.

3.  **Reinforcement Learning Trains LLMs to Explain Human Decisions.**
    Get ready for a cool [new direction (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11614) in cognitive modeling: training LLMs to explain human decisions using reinforcement learning! Researchers are using outcome-based RL to guide LLMs in spitting out **explicit reasoning chains**. The big goal? To nail both predictive accuracy and crystal-clear, readable explanations at the same time. This means AI won't just be some mysterious black box; it'll finally be able to tell us *why* it does what it does. Pretty awesome, right? ✨

4.  **Unstable Mechanisms in RLVR Training Revealed.**
    So, the unstable mechanisms in RLVR training have been revealed! While verifiable reward [Reinforcement Learning (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01103) is supposed to continuously boost reasoning, MoE architectures often just crash and burn. Researchers have now cooked up a **"goal-level hacking"** framework to explain this mess. The key takeaway? Token-level credit misalignment is creating bogus signals, causing a wild and abnormal growth in the train-inference discrepancy. What a headache! 😵‍💫

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **Musk Announces SpaceX and xAI Merger.**
    Well, the shoe has dropped! 🚀 Musk just announced the merger of SpaceX and xAI, creating a powerhouse valued at a staggering **$1.25 trillion**! In an [internal letter (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2026/02/375614.html), Musk outlined plans to accelerate the deployment of space-based data centers. He's making a bold prediction: space-based AI is the *only* path to true scalability. The vision? Launching millions of satellites to build a massive **orbital data center** network, pushing us towards a Kardashev Type II civilization. Talk about out of this world! 🤯

2.  **SpaceX Applies to Launch Millions of Computing Satellites.**
    SpaceX is serious, applying to launch millions of computing satellites! The heart of this plan isn't about boosting comms; it's all about building an [orbital data center (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/25192). This constellation is projected to pack a total compute power of **80 EFLOPS**! By harnessing the cold vacuum of space, they're tackling those pesky heat dissipation issues head-on. Expect a launch in 2028 and completion by 2030. Honestly, traditional IDC vendors might be looking at a serious, game-changing blow. 🤯

3.  **Tencent Hunyuan Attracts Another Top Scientist.**
    Big news! Tencent Hunyuan just snagged another top-tier scientist. Tsinghua Ph.D. Pang Tianyu has officially joined the team as the [Chief Research Scientist (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/25199) in the Hunyuan Multimodal Department. His main gig? Diving deep into **reinforcement learning technology** research. Before this, he was doing his thing at Singapore's Sea AI Lab. This is a huge win, following hot on the heels of their recruitment of Yao Shunyu! Talk about building a dream team! ✨

### Social Media Buzz

1.  **Vibe Coding Concept Celebrates First Anniversary.**
    Happy first anniversary to Andrej Karpathy's [Vibe Coding (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/2018352113550577763) concept! 🎉 His core philosophy? Fully embrace LLMs and pretty much forget code even exists. Karpathy's take is that today's models are just too damn powerful; he even claims to only use voice to chat with Composer. Wild!

2.  **Codex App Experience: The Silent Engineer.**
    User experience with the Codex App? Some folks are calling it the "silent engineer." One user's [review (AI News)](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/2018649006591889833) pointed out that Codex just "gets its head down and works" without any fuss or fancy dashboards you'd see in other apps. Apparently, it's seriously lacking the "emotional value" that Claude Code provides. Talk about a personality deficit! 😅

3.  **Call for Unified Skills Directory Path.**
    OpenAI developers are making a loud call for a unified skills directory path! They want all agents to consistently use the `[.agents/skills (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2018517484337602750)` folder for storing skill files. This would ditch all those fragmented, independent paths and stop us from drowning in a sea of duplicate directories. Make it happen, folks! 🙌

4.  **Brex Company's Four-Level Classification of AI Capability.**
    Someone shared Brex company's pretty cool four-level classification of employee AI capability! According to [Brex company (AI News)](https://x.com/vista8/status/2018639539036975489), there's the User (who can ask questions), the Advocate (who promotes tools), the Builder (who can actually make stuff), and the Native (who seamlessly integrates AI into their daily grind). So, where do *you* land on that scale? 🤔

5.  **Discussion on Learning to Code Strategies in the AI Era.**
    There's a super hot discussion brewing on Hacker News about strategies for [learning to code in the AI era (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46866165)! The main takeaways? You gotta solidify your **algorithm and architecture** fundamentals, view LLMs as your trusty mentors (not the be-all, end-all authority), and embrace that deliberate struggle to truly learn. Some people are even getting a bit anxious that coding itself might become totally commoditized. Food for thought! 🤯
