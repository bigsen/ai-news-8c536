# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially saying "Yup, I agree!" to these terms. 🙏

## 1. About Our Services
The Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, community interactions, and more! Just a heads-up, some content is only for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy!
- Users, you're fully responsible for your account's security and all activities under it. And a big **NOPE** to transferring or sharing your account – that's strictly forbidden! 🙅‍♀️
- We reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you breach these terms. Just sayin'!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis. You'll see all the costs clearly laid out on the checkout page. No surprises! 💰
- All payments are processed through third-party platforms (like Stripe or PayPal), so don't worry – we never store your payment info. Your security is key! 🔒
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew**, unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Make a note! 🗓️
- **Our 14-day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at a refund. For subscriptions past 14 days or non-first-time purchases, all payments are **non-refundable**, unless legally required. No exceptions! 🚫

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission. Seriously, don't! 📝
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content for personal learning and reading. It's for you, not for reselling!
- For commercial use or if you want to cite us extensively, hit us up to get authorization. We're usually pretty chill, but ask first! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It's a big **NO-GO** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Play nice! 🚫
- Also, it's strictly **forbidden** to bulk download, crawl, or crack member content using technical means. We see you! 👀
- We reserve the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Consider yourself warned! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate all or part of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just giving you the heads-up!
- The Site **is not liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things are just out of our hands. 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical). Always consult an expert for that! 🧑‍💻
- The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses incurred by users due to their use of the Site's content or services. Use at your own risk, folks! 😬

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. So, California law rules! ⚖️
- Any disputes arising from or related to these terms shall first be resolved amicably through good-faith negotiation between both parties. If negotiations hit a snag, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's try to be friends first, though! 🤝
