# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as 'the Site' or 'we'). Before you dive into using our services, you really should check out these Terms of Service. Seriously, by accessing or using the Site, you're pretty much saying 'Yep, I agree!' to these terms. So, let's get into it!

## 1. Service Introduction
The Site provides users with paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Keep in mind, some of this awesome content is only accessible to our subscribers! 🚀

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- To register an account, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set up a password.
- Your account's security and all activities are your responsibility. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account!
- If you ever break these terms, the Site has the right to **suspend or terminate** your account. Just a heads up! 🚨

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our subscription services are billed either monthly or annually, and the exact fees will be clearly shown on the checkout page.
- All payments are handled via third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, the Site doesn't store any of your payment info! 🔒
- Heads up: your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before the current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-day Refund Policy** is pretty straightforward: if you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets this one-time refund chance. If it's past 14 days or you're not a first-timer, then sorry, folks, **no refunds** after payment, unless the law absolutely forces our hand. 🤷‍♀️

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- All original content, folks, is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means you can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without getting our permission first. Capisce? 😉
- As a user, you only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content for your personal learning and reading enjoyment. Just for you! ✨
- If you're thinking commercial use or need to quote us heavily, please hit up the Site to get proper authorization. Let's chat! 🤝

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Don't** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep it clean! 🚫
- **Don't** try any techy tricks like bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking our member-exclusive content. That's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
- The Site reserves the right to remove any inappropriate content and will **ban users** who violate these rules. Play fair, folks! 🔨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or totally terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Just so you know! 💨
- If something like an act of God, a server meltdown, or a third-party service interruption causes content to be temporarily unavailable, the Site **isn't liable for compensation**. Bummer, we know! ⛈️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The info provided on the Site is purely for your reference. It **doesn't constitute** any professional advice whatsoever (like financial, legal, medical, you get the drill!). 📚
- For any direct or indirect losses you might experience from using the Site's content or services, the Site **takes no responsibility**. Just laying it out there! 😬

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Got it? 📜
- If any disputes pop up that are caused by or related to these terms, both parties agree to try and solve them amicably first. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's play fair! ⚖️
