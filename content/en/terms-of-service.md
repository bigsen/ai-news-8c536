# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (let's call it "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to really read through these Terms of Service. By hitting up our site or using our stuff, you're basically saying, "Yep, I agree to all these terms!"

## 1. What We're All About
**Our services**: We hook our users up with awesome paid subscription content and exclusive member perks, like blog posts, special resources, e-books, and even community vibes! Just a heads-up: some of that good stuff is only for our subscribed members.

## 2. Your Account & Registration
*   **Account registration**: To get started, you'll need to drop a valid email address and cook up a password to set up your account.
*   **Your responsibility**: Listen up! You're the captain of your account, meaning you're totally responsible for its security and everything that happens under your login. Seriously, **no** transferring or sharing your account – it's a big no-no.
*   **Our rights**: If you play fast and loose with these terms, we absolutely have the right to **suspend or even terminate** your account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Billing**: Our subscriptions roll on a monthly or annual basis, and we'll always show you the exact fees on the checkout page – no surprises!
*   **Payment processing**: All your payments are handled securely by cool third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal, etc.). So, don't sweat it, we never actually store your payment info ourselves. Phew!
*   **Auto-renewal**: Your subscription is set to **automatically renew**, which is super convenient! But if you want to bail, just make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
*   **Our 14-day refund policy**: Newbies, listen up! If you're a first-time subscriber and our service isn't quite hitting the mark, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just ping us at the contact email at the very end of these terms and spill the beans on why you're calling it quits. Heads-up: each user gets this one-time refund opportunity. After those 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, payments are typically **non-refundable** once they're made, unless the law specifically says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   **Content copyright**: Just so you know, all the awesome original content here is **copyrighted by hubtoday**! Please, pretty please, don't copy, repost, or use it for commercial stuff without getting our green light first.
*   **Your access rights**: When you subscribe, you're getting a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access our content purely for your personal learning and reading pleasure. That's the deal!
*   **Commercial use & citations**: Thinking of using our content for commercial purposes or dropping a ton of quotes? You gotta get in touch with us for authorization first. Capiche?

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **Prohibited content**: Let's be cool. It's an absolute **no-go** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Period.
*   **Prohibited technical activities**: Also, **don't even think** about using any sneaky tech tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member content. That's a definite red flag!
*   **Our enforcement rights**: If someone's acting up, we absolutely have the right to yank down any inappropriate content and **boot any rule-breaking users** right off the site. Consider yourself warned!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **Service changes**: Heads up! We might tweak, pause, or even ditch parts or all of our services whenever we need to, and we might not even give you a heads-up. That's just how the tech world rolls sometimes.
*   **Interruptions & liability**: If our content suddenly becomes unavailable because of crazy stuff like force majeure, server burps, or third-party service snafus, we're **not on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it happens.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **Information disclaimer**: The info we share here is purely for kicks and giggles (okay, mostly for reference!). It definitely **doesn't count** as any kind of pro advice – like for your finances, legal stuff, or even medical woes. Got it?
*   **Liability disclaimer**: Look, we're **not responsible for** any direct or indirect losses you might run into from using our content or services. Just keeping it transparent!

## 8. Governing Law
*   **Governing law**: Alright, these Terms of Service are totally squared away under the laws of California, USA, and that's how we'll interpret 'em – no weird legal conflicts allowed.
*   **Dispute resolution**: Got a bone to pick about these terms? First off, let's try to hash it out nicely and friendly. If we can't sort it out that way, then you agree to take any disputes to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Fair enough?
